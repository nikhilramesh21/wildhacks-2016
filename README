#Idea: 
A webapp that allows you to select classes and tells you which of your friends are also in that class next quarter.
#Implementation 
The front end implementation was done in HTML, CSS and Javascript in the form of a clickable webpage 
The data was generated and parsed using python and the Northwestern ASG API.
We attempted to deploy this app using a django framework but were not able to do so. We intend to learn this framework and complete this app in the near future.
